Putting together implementations of a Fully-Connected Neural Network and a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) using a modular approach with `Python` and `Numpy`. For each layer we will implement a `forward` and a `backward` function. The `forward` function will receive inputs, weights, and other parameters and will return both an output and a `cache` object storing data needed for the backward pass. Fully-connected networks are a good testbed for experimentation because they are very computationally efficient, but in practice all state-of-the-art results use convolutional networks instead. We will also explore different update rules for optimization.
